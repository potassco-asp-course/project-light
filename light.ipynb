    "# Problem Description.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of this project is to solve a logic [puzzle](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Akari/) in which a two-dimensional playing field is to be illuminated with lights using ASP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The playing field is a square grid with a few cells predetermined. The given cells are either empty or contain an integer between 0 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the puzzle is to place lights on the non-predetermined cells so that each non-predetermined cell is illuminated by (at least) one light horizontally or vertically, with light rays not shining through predetermined (empty or containing a number) cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional constraints are that no two lights may illuminate each other and that for each cell with a number ``n``, exactly ``n`` horizontally or vertically adjacent cells must each contain a light.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example is shown in the next figure.\n",
    "![A light puzzle and its solution](img/light.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The left side shows the playing field with eight predetermined cells, three of which are empty and five of which each contain a number. On the right side the lights are also shown, the placement of which forms a solution for the puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that each non-given (white) cell either contains a light or has a horizontal or vertical connection to a cell with a light.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are no such connections between the cells with lights, e.g. cells (4,4) and (4,6) are separated from each other by the cell with the number 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, each given cell with a number has the required number of horizontally or vertically adjacent cells with lights."
